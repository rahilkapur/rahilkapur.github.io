			<dt> <a class="rlink" href="https://guide.wisc.edu/courses/comp_sci/">Comp Sci 200</a></dt>
			<dd> This is an introductory class to programming that I found pretty easy, but I learned a lot of new things. </dd>
			<dt> <a class="rlink" href="https://cs300-www.cs.wisc.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Welcome-CS-300-Programming-II.pdf">Comp Sci 300</a></dt>
			<dd> This course introduced lots of new topics such as Stacks, Queues, and Trees which was a lot of work but rewarding.</dd>
			<dt> <a class="rlink" href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~gerald/cs354/Spring2019/">Comp Sci 354</a></dt>
			<dd> This class was the first low level class I took and was very different from the other CS classes I took, but I learned about pointers, assembly, and memory allocation. </dd>
			<dt> <a class="rlink" href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~shuchi/courses/577-S20/">Comp Sci 577</a></dt>
			<dd> Probably the hardest course I've taken here, and it was a challenge, but I learned a lot theoretically and would defintely recommend to take as it helps on interview practice and Leetcode. </dd>
			<dt> <a class="rlink" href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~kandasamy/courses/22fall-cs540/">Comp Sci 540</a></dt>
			<dd> This class was not what I expected it to be, a lot more math and not a lot of detailed explanations on each topic, but teaches you the basics about Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Reinforcment Learning, NLP. </dd>
			<dt> <a class="rlink" href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~paris/cs564-s18/">Comp Sci 564</a></dt>
			<dd> I'm currently taking this class! So far it is the most interesting out of all the upper level CS classes I've taken here. You learn SQL, the basics of DBMS, Relational Algebra, Functional Dependencies. </dd>
